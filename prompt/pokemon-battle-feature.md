## 🎮 Feature Overview
Build a **Pokémon Battle Simulator** that:
- Lets users select **two Pokémon** to battle.
- Fetches their **stats, types, and sprites** from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
- Simulates a simple **turn-based fight** using this formula:

damage = base_attack ± random_factor − opponent_defense

markdown
Copy code

- Displays HP bars and logs each turn (e.g., “Pikachu used Thunderbolt!”).
- Includes **animation** when a Pokémon attacks or is hit — similar to the classic Pokémon games (e.g., shake, flash, or slide forward).

---

## 🧱 Implementation Details

### 1️⃣ New Page & Route
- Create a new route `/battle` in the Python web app (Flask, FastAPI, or Django).
- Create a corresponding template file: `battle.html`.
- Add a “Battle Simulator” link in the navbar that routes to this new page.

### 2️⃣ UI Elements (HTML/JS)
- Two dropdowns to select Pokémon (populate via PokéAPI).
- “Start Battle” button to initiate combat.
- Display area that includes:
- Pokémon sprites (left vs right).
- HP bars for both Pokémon.
- Text log showing turn-by-turn battle messages.
- Optional: add an “Attack” button for manual turns.

### 3️⃣ Battle Logic (Python or JavaScript)
- Fetch Pokémon stats from PokéAPI when the user selects them.
- Store key stats: `attack`, `defense`, `speed`, `hp`.
- Determine who attacks first (based on `speed`).
- Each turn:
- Calculate damage:
  ```python
  damage = base_attack + random.randint(-5, 5) - opponent_defense
  ```
- Reduce the opponent’s HP.
- Update HP bar UI.
- Trigger hit animation on the opponent’s sprite.
- Append text to the battle log.

### 4️⃣ Animation Effects
- **Attack animation** → attacker sprite slides forward briefly.
- **Hit animation** → target sprite shakes or blinks.
- Optional: add short **sound effects** for attacks and hits.

### 5️⃣ Styling
- Use a responsive layout with Pokémon facing each other.
- Add a background similar to a Pokémon battle arena.
- Use **CSS transitions** or **keyframes** for animations.
- Ensure mobile-friendly scaling for sprites and HP bars.

## ⚙️ Implemented API Endpoints ✅
```js
// Get Pokemon list for dropdown
fetch('/api/pokemon-list')
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data.pokemon));

// Get Pokemon battle stats
fetch('/api/battle/pokemon/pikachu')
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data.stats));

// Simulate battle turn
fetch('/api/battle/simulate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ attacker: pokemon1, defender: pokemon2 })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(result => console.log(result));
```
